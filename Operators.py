# operators are ie +,-, these perform simple calculations
x = 60
y = 7
print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x - y)  # Subtraction
print(x * y)  # Multiplication
print(x / y)  # division
print(x % y)  # modulus...returns the remainder after division

# Comparison Operators... used to compare values
a = 34
b = 23

print(a < b)
print(a == b)  # equal to
print(a <= b)
print(a >= b)
print(a != b)  # not equal to
print(a > b)

# Assignment operators

print(num)

z = 2
z += 4
print(z)  # the operator follows Bodmas...precedence depending on the opera

number = 45
number *= 2
print(number)

# Logical Operators..

print(num1 > num2 or num1 == num2)
